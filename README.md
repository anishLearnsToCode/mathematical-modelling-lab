## Running Projects Locally
Clone this repository on your machine and enter the project directory.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anishLearnsToCode/mathematical-modelling-lab.git
cd mathematical-modelling-lab/lab/
```

Navigate to a project of your choice from the list below and run it as follows e.g. to run 
experiment 1 
```bash
cd experiment-01
matlab -nosplash -nodesktop -r "run('experiment_1.m');"
``` 

Similarly you can run any experiment in the lab by executing a similar expession as:

```bash
cd experiment-n
matlab -nosplash -nodesktop -r "run('experiment_n.m');"
```   

where `n` stands for the experiment number.
